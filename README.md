# Harvey_Li-SDK



Testing
To test the SDK, you can fork and clone this repo and then go into the Harvey-SDK directory and run:

npm run build

Next, you can now leave the Harvey-SDK directory and go into the SDK-Test, and run: (ensure that you have typescript installed globally, or else tsc will not run)

tsc
node dist/app.js

The result should show in your terminal now!
